# 🚀 AuctionFi - Transparent Bidding with Time-Bound Rules

Welcome to **AuctionFi**, a simple yet powerful smart contract built using **Solidity**.  
It enables **transparent, time-bound auctions** where bidders can compete fairly, and the process remains completely on-chain and verifiable.

---

## 🧠 Project Description

**AuctionFi** is a blockchain-based auction system designed for **transparency**, **fairness**, and **simplicity**.  
The smart contract allows users to bid using Ether, automatically handle refunds for losing bids, and ensure no further bids are accepted after the auction time ends.

It’s perfect for beginners who want to **learn how decentralized auctions work** on Ethereum!

## 💡 What It Does

- Deploy a simple auction that runs for a fixed amount of time.  
- Accept bids only if they are higher than the current highest bid.  
- Automatically refund previous highest bidders when they are outbid.  
- Allow bidders to withdraw their refunds safely.  
- Let the auction owner end the auction and receive the winning bid after time expires.
