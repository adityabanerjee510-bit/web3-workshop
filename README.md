## 🧠 Project Description

**AuctionFi** is a blockchain-based auction system designed for **transparency**, **fairness**, and **simplicity**.  
The smart contract allows users to bid using Ether, automatically handle refunds for losing bids, and ensure no further bids are accepted after the auction time ends.

It’s perfect for beginners who want to **learn how decentralized auctions work** on Ethereum!
